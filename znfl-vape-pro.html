So, something I’ve always done since I started rock climbing was to clean my gear with boiling water. I’ve taken to doing this with my vape gear as well when I want to clean it. I boil a large pot of distilled water and bring it to a roll, then using a slotted spoon I’ll dip my parts into the water for 20-30 seconds (it’s important the metal gets very hot). The movement of the water helps dislodge anything in crevices, and by heating the metal up it evaporates the water quickly Проверяйте доступность имён в Minecraft, изучайте историю их изменения у отдельных аккаунтов, а также их UUID, просматривайте скины в 3D и многое другое. So I bought a smok mag kit a few months ago and I've been having problems with a leaking tank. People tell me smok is not a good product that has lots of problems, I bought it knowing nothing. I am looking to buy a new mini vape mod but idk what to get I want the smok mag mini but it seems that people don't like smok products. So what kinda advice do u have for a mini mod that has decent battery and is good quality, because again I know nothing I just mindlessly Vape Tool экономит ваши время и деньги, расчитывая толко идеальные спирали и жидкости Vape Tool Pro это огромный арсенал для каждого вэйпера.

My fellow vapers and pros of vaping: I would really appreciate it if you could help me answer a few questions that i have spent hours researching and still am confused about. First, the problem is that i have been getting a nasty burnt taste after only hitting my vape 3 to 4 times in a row. The vape has also been getting pretty hot. This happens even when i have just changed my coil a couple of days prior. I have an innokin oceanus with a smok baby beast tank and a T8 baby beast coil. Say I turn it on and leave it sitting for a couple minutes until it shuts off, not hitting I realize how both of these vaporizers are miles apart, I may purchase both In the end, a sesh device and a on the go. Which device hits harder? I'd like to use my herb efficiently, but would still like to make edibles out of it. But I also would like to get stoned off my ass. So which should I go for? Or should It uses a 3200mAh 18650 Samsung but can a 3500mAh be used? I have a few already and would like to use them instead of ordering some 3200mAh. 
I want to get a vape for the incognito sesh but I don't know what vaporizer I should get. And I don't have hundreds of dollars to drop either. A little help my fellow. Pretty much what the title says, I am thinking about getting a dry herb vape but I would like to know what people have to say about them. Are they worth the money? Do they smoke well? Suggestions on brand would also be appreciated. So, when I first started vaping, I mostly stuck to cheaper setups, specifically cheap clearomizers, and even some cartomizers. It was okay, but I got frustrated having to replace many of them fairly quickly due to quality of the plastic or not being able to clean them as frequently because they did not come apart, and most had no way to replace the head if they went bad. I finally invested in a Kanger Protank. The taste was world's better, and over the long run, I spend less money since replace. 
Hi, who would you recommend as a leading authority on vaping? Specifically looking for YouTube Channels but blogs can do. For example, I have the following : RipTrippers : https://www.youtube.com/user/RiPTrippers IndoorSmokers : https://www.youtube.com/user/IndoorSmokers todd ecigreviews : https://www.youtube.com/user/toddecigreviews pbusardo : https://www.youtube.com/user/pbusardo Getting into Twisted messes recently : https://www.youtube.com/user/manofaction2828 I'm one of the minority who seems to actually enjoy using the MX V4. So much so, that my screw heads got worn out. No problem, I have the bag of extras that came with it. Well shit, the extras are too short. And yes, I KNOW they are the right ones because I label my bags. So, I spent some time digging through my plethora of extra bits and was lucky enough to find some that fit. The Royal Hunter uses the same diameter and threading, plus they are grub screws. so they tighten Alright brothers, I wanna blow some big clouds while experimenting with coil builds. I usually vape my VamoV5 with a protank 2 ( 2x32g twisted kanthal micro coil with cotton) and its been decent enough, got me off of analogues and has become a great hobby for me in the process. Only ever built my own coils but the possibilities are limited with VV/VW and PT2 I've done alot of research into it RBA/Sub-Ohming ( equipment, safety etc)and ended up with an IGO W3 and Nemesis clones which are being. until now, every tank/cartomizer/atomizer on the market seems to under perform. The I-Con Pro tank is a 510 threaded tank which can mounted on an ego twist. turn it to 3.4-3.7ish volts, and mmm mmm. dabbing has never been better ! if you have questions I have been using a Pax Ploom for the last 6 months and its been great. I use it on the medium setting and 3 draws usually gets me to around a 7. The general consensus seems to be that a portable vape cant really compare to a desktop. So, I did my research, saved up, and finally got a SSV. I also got a water pipe attachment and have been experimenting with the different heat(knob) settings. I usually turn it on with the knob turned on max for a few minutes then turn it down to about My spouse Is looking to buy new batteries for their Vape-Pro, They have been buying the £12 one on the totally wicked website, I was wondering if these ( would be worth getting as they were recommended to me for a Vamo. P.s. I am no expert but I believe the Vape-Pro is a TW rebranded Zmax v2 if that helps, Cheers! Edit: Found the exact same ones they are using here (https://www.fasttech.com. 
So my Vamo has been giving me random 9.9ohm readings since mid afternoon yesterday, and it will briefly quit firing mid-toot. So I took off the top of the Vamo v2 for the first time, and pushed up the center pin just a hair, and resoldered the connection (black wire) that had been torn when I took the top off (first time soldering too!). In addition to being productive there, I drilled 3 1/16" holes into my Optimus RDA and one 1/16" hole into my aga-t2. Now, the problem is that I keep getting. The pill bottle method is definitely the best way to prepare your bud if you don't have the finishing grinder, but sometimes it can be a real bitch to shake that thing til it's powder grade, especially if your bud is not well dried. My solution to all of this is to vape the roughly ground herb for a few draws and only then to use the pill bottle. This way you get a fine powder in no time and you don't annoy everyone else around with your pathetic, loud bottle. Also if you happen to have forgott. I had a gentleman vape pro wax cart. I was trying to get it open and I really couldn't do it. There was a bit of white film on the tip so I looked inside, and I noticed that there was webbing. I realized a dab spider built a web in there. I showed it to my girlfriend and she freaked out, wouldn't even look (I mean, c'mon, it's kinda cool that a spider made a home there), and made me throw it away. I have a picture but it kinda sucks, so I won't bother showing it. But this is actually What’s up folks? Today I’ve got an RTA to discuss with you that looks to build on the promise of its predecessors, this is the Vandy Vape Kylin II ( The RTA was sent to me by the folks at Vandy Vape for the purposes of this review. So, the Kylin II is trying to build on the positives of the Kylin and Kylin mini, does it deliver on that promise or fall to the same (or worse) pitfalls? Let’s discuss! #Photo Dump ----------------------. What’s up folks? Today I’ve got a single coil RDA to discuss, one that is sort of aptly named. The Vandy Vape Paradox! ( The atomizer was sent to me by Vandy vape for the purposes of this review. So, it looks like a big real cloudy thing, but in truth it’s designed as a flavor forward atomizer, so… Does it deliver on either side of that equation? Let’s discuss! #Photo Dump ---------------------------- Imgur Album. First time in here and I see Suterra isn’t well liked. So far the potency has been good for me. My problem is once I get below the intake holes there is a bubble created in them. There is still plenty of medicine left below the hole. I usually put the cart in a ziplock and put that in warm water to get the med to cover the hole. It never absorbs tho due to the bubble. Any ideas how to fix this? I have another refillable cart I can use but I was wondering if anyone else has any ideas.not I’m looking for an electronic portable vape which I could carry with me at all times, fitting in a pants pocket comfortably for spring/summer. Vape also needs to be able to handle extreme hot AND cold weather as I live in Boston. I’m a joint or bowl smoker mostly (own a pax but never liked the resistance on it) and would want a similar “punch” that I get from Hitting a joint or bowl. I’ve had my eye on the ArGo, Solo 2, and the Mighty/crafty. But would </p>
